# Known Limitations of Fortigate Security Appliance 1Gbps
{: #known-limitations-of-fortigate-security-appliance-1gbps}

The FortiGate Security Appliance (FSA) 1Gbps has the following known limitations:

* Incompatible with Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) due to the way ARP is processed.

* High Availability failover functionality is not exposed to the user. If the master firewall malfunctions, but does not failover automatically, a support ticket will be required. Device monitoring for critical services is recommended to ensure that firewalls are appropriately passing traffic.

* A FortiGate Security Appliance cannot be deployed on a VLAN that is currently associated with a Network Gateway, Hardware Firewall, or another FortiGate Security Appliance.

* The FortiGate Security Appliance is associated with a single public customer VLAN (the "inside" VLAN) and cannot access the private network.
