{: shortdesc}

1. From your browser, open the [IBM Cloud UI Console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/security/firewalls/multivlan/provision){: new_window} and log in to your account.
2. Click the navigation menu in the [IBM Cloud Catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com) and select **Classic Infrastructure > Network > IP Management > VLANs** and click the firewall device that you want to cancel.
3. Click the **Device Details** page. From the **Configuration** tab, click the **Actions** drop down menu and choose **Cancel Device**. In the confirmation dialog, choose whether you want to cancel immediately or in the next billing cycle. Click **Continue** to continue cancelling the device.

Cancelling the firewall leaves all devices on the VLAN without front-end firewall protection. This service is provided month to month and billing will be discontinued for the next month upon cancellation.
