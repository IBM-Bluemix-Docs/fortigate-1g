# FortiGate Security Appliance 1 Gbps end of marketing
{: #FSA-EOM}

IBM Cloud will no longer market or sell our FortiGate Security Appliance 1 Gbps and Dedicated Firewall offerings. All instances of this service are deprecated. Existing instances can be used until 30 May 2021. 
{: deprecated}

A 90-day EOS notification email will be sent at a later date. To minimize impact on your business, we encourage you to consider [alternative options](/docs/hardware-firewall-shared?topic=fortigate-10g-exploring-firewalls) to replace your existing firewalls. 

Contact IBM Cloud Sales with any questions about upgrade options, or reach out to your Customer Success Manager or Technical Account Manager if you have these services. These can help you determine the best options to replace your affected firewalls, including our latest full-featured security gateway offering, [IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX with Content Security Bundle](/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-getting-started).

IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX offers an enhanced customer experience that includes:

* Support for protecting multiple public and private VLANs
* Administrative access to the virtual appliance
* Dedicated Bare Metal Hardware, also available in high-availability configurations
* Support for multiple instance sizes and multiple-gigabyte throughputs
* IPS/IDS/UTM features for 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps deployments 

You can also migrate to other gateway offerings, such as the [FortiGate Secuity Appliance (FSA) 10 Gbps](/docs/fortigate-10g?topic=fortigate-10g-getting-started) and the [IBM Cloud Virtual Router Appliance](/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-getting-started).
 
FSA 10 Gbps is a hardware gateway appliance similar to FSA 1 Gbps, but with higher performance and advanced IPS/IDS/UTM features. 

The IBM Cloud Virtual Router Appliance is a full-featured enterprise router that has firewall, traffic shaping, policy-based routing, VPN, and other features.
