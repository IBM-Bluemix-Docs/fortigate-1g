# Getting started with FortiGate Security Appliance 1 Gbps
{: #getting-started}

The FortiGate Security Appliance (FSA) 1 Gbps provides customers with an essential layer of security that prevents unwanted traffic from hitting your servers.

All instances of this service are deprecated. Existing instances can be used until it is no longer supported on 30 May 2021. Use one of the other available [firewall options](/docs/fortigate-1g?topic=fortigate-10g-exploring-firewalls) to get our latest mobile security capabilities on IBM Cloud. For migration information, see [Migrating FortiGate Security Appliance 1Gbps](/docs/fortigate-1g?topic=fortigate-1g-migration-overview).
