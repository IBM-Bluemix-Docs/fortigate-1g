# Getting Started With Fortigate Security Appliance 1Gbps
{: #getting-started-with-fortigate-security-appliance-1gbps}

The Fortigate Security Appliance (FSA) 1Gbps provides customers with an essential layer of security that prevents unwanted traffic from hitting your servers, reducing your attack surface, and allowing your server resources to be dedicated for their intended use.  The FSA is a network device that is connected upstream from the server environment (pod), blocking unwanted traffic before it reaches your server.  

You can order the FSA 1Gbps from the VLANs page in the customer portal.

1. From your browser, open [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal navigation, select **Network > IP Management > VLANs**.
3. Scroll to the VLAN you want to protect and click on the **Add Firewall** link in the same row. This link opens the **Order Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)** page.
4. Select **FortiGate Security Appliance** to order a single firewall or **FortiGate Security Appliance (High Availability)** to order a firewall pair. 
5. Enter your payment information and click **Continue**.
6. In the next screen, enter promo codes if applicable, read and agree to the Master Service Agreement and click on **Place Order**.
