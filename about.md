# About FortiGate Security Appliance 1 Gbps
{: #about-fortigate-security-appliance-1gbps}

A FortiGate Security Appliance 1 Gbps (FSA) is a dedicated single-tenant network device that is connected upstream from a server that protects any or all servers on a public VLAN. It is purchased separate from a server and can be added to a VLAN at any time. IBMÂ© Cloud deploys the FortiGate 1 Gbps within a Virtual Domain (VDOM) on the dedicated appliance. You have full access to that virtual domain without compromising the integrity of the device.

All instances of this service are deprecated. Existing instances can be used until it is no longer supported on 30 May 2021. Use one of the other available [firewall options](/docs/fortigate-1g?topic=fortigate-10g-exploring-firewalls) to get our latest security capabilities on IBM Cloud. For migration information, see [Migrating FortiGate Security Appliance 1Gbps](/docs/fortigate-1g?topic=fortigate-1g-migration-overview)

With the FSA 1 Gbps, you have advanced features and the ability to fine-tune the device to a much higher degree than other products. The firewall blocks or shapes traffic before the traffic ever reaches the server. The main advantages are that a server handles 'good' traffic exclusively and that bandwidth can be constrained for less critical communications.

You can manage the FSA either through the web-based FortiOS GUI or the CLI (Command Line Interface) by using SSH. High availability can also be ordered, which provides two appliances in active-passive deployment with synchronized configurations.

Since monthly server bandwidth is recorded at the server switch port, traffic that is blocked by the FSA 1 Gbps is not counted against your monthly allotments. As a result, the need to pay for unwanted traffic is eliminated.
